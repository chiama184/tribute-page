        The years will always roll on by
        and time will always pass,
        but every memory I have of you
        will definitely always last.I like to smile when <br>
        I think of you.
        I try not to be sad.
        Itâ€™s pretty easy to do.I know for a fact that <br>
        everyone in this little town that knew you adored you <br>
        so much and they will miss you to pieces.                </p>
